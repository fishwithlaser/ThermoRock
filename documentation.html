<h1>ThermoCalc</h1>
<p> python script for calculating possible thermodynamics reactions of minerals.
</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p> There are a few features of the code with a few packages. Briefly they are </p>:
<h3> mods/</h3>
<h4> mkruns.py</h4>
<p> This package produces a list of opperations to be used by python - 
to find possible reaction. Functions include: <b> </b>
<h4> matrixOps.py</h4>
<p> This package is responsible for basic matrix opperations. Functions
include: <b> compress</b> (compresses matrix) 
<h4> findRxn.py </h4>
<p> Package uses list of operations (queue) to output a list of successful reactions.
This will not be ready for a whie.</p>
<h4> loader.py </h4>
<p> Package loads datafram and concerts XLSX. Function also loads dataframes as 
hashmaps. Functions include <b> change </b> (converts), <b> load </b> (loads
csv), <b> minerals </b> (creates minerals-populated pandas-dataframe), 
<b>actmod</b> (loads required data into G-calcs), <b>Iter4</b> (creates list
of opperations </b><p>
<h4> metamathicCalc.py </h4>
<p> main script -  performs required math to solve </p>
